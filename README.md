# Tableau_BritishAirways

This is my Tableau practice project that I learned from youtube. The data for this dashboard contains reviews from customers toward British Airways. It shows their rating toward cabin staff's service, entertainment, food, etc. Based on the data, a dashboard is created to visualize how does the rating for each country. The user in the dashboard could choose the metric or the country that they want to see by selecting or clicking the appropriate button.

The following dashboard could be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/william.xu5271/viz/BritishAirwaysVisualization_17269173509070/Dashboard1).
